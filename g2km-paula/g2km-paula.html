                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p> Hi!! I am a senior, with a major in computer science. <br>
                            I love computers and technology, this degree fascinates and <br>
                            intrigues me to keep wanting to learn more about it. I enjoy <br>
                            coding and want to continue to improve that skill. I spend a lot <br>
                            of my free time with my family and I have an older brother,<br>
                            a dog named Francis, and a cat named Kitten. </p>

                        <h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                            <li>Participate, as part of a team to design,<br>
                                implementation and testing of a <br>
                                medium-to-large software project</li>
                            <li>Professional ethics</li>
                            <li>Intellectual properties</li>
                            <li>Professional communication</li>
                        </ul> 

                        <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
                        <p> My hobbies include spending a lot of time on the computer,<br>
                            either playing video games, searching the web, or just chatting with<br>
                            my friends. I enjoy reading and researching to learn new information. <br>
                            I enjoy spending any free time I have outdoors.</p>

                        <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
                        <p> I was always fascinated on how a computer worked internally<br>
                            and externally. As I have always loved playing video games, one day<br>
                            I decided I would learn how to build my own computer. I thought <br>
                            it would be interesting to learn how each component worked <br>
                            together inside the computer, so I learned first-hand on how it works. </p>
